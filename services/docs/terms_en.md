        Project Nature Statement
    </div>
    Airlock is a <b>non-profit</b> open-source project.
    This project was created purely out of the development team's interest in blockchain security technology and for the purpose of technical validation of "offline signing" solutions. We <b>do not aim for profit</b>, do not sell any pre-installed hardware, and do not provide any form of paid custody services.

<div class="text-h6 text-weight-bold text-grey-9 q-mt-md q-mb-sm">1. Delivery "As Is"</div>

Airlock's software code (App, firmware) and hardware design blueprints (PCB, schematics) are distributed based on the **MIT Open Source License** or **GPL License**.

- **No Warranty**: We provide the software and documentation "as is" and **provide no express or implied warranties**, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

<div class="text-h6 text-weight-bold text-grey-9 q-mt-md q-mb-sm">2. Asset Security Responsibility</div>

As a non-custodial wallet solution, Airlock grants you complete control over your assets, which also means you must bear full responsibility for safekeeping:

1.  **Self-held Private Keys**: The development team cannot access, recover, or reset your private keys/mnemonic phrases.
2.  **Irreversible**: Blockchain transactions are irreversible once broadcast. When manually confirming signatures on the Raspberry Pi screen, please verify the transfer address and amount carefully.
3.  **Exemption from Liability for Loss**: The project team is not responsible for asset losses caused by users forgetting passwords, losing mnemonic phrase backups, or physical damage to the device.

<div class="text-h6 text-weight-bold text-grey-9 q-mt-md q-mb-sm">3. DIY Hardware Risk</div>

Airlock runs on Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and user-assembled hardware, involving a certain DIY threshold:

- **Assembly Risk**: Hardware damage (including Raspberry Pi and peripheral accessories) caused by user soldering errors, short circuits, electrostatic breakdown, or improper power usage is unrelated to open-source code contributors.
- **Supply Chain Security**: We recommend users purchase Raspberry Pi and electronic components only through official authorization or reputable channels to prevent supply chain attacks (such as the implantation of malicious chips).
